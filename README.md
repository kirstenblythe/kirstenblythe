- 👋 Hi, I’m @kirstenblythe
- 👀 I’m interested in using computational tools to decipher the epigenetic marks that unravel across the lifespan.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use exsiting DNA methylation datasets to meta-analyse the DNA methylation changes that occur with chronological and biological ageing in all human tissues and cell types.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sharing of data to generate the largest database of DNA methylation data across a multitude of human tissues to study epigenetic ageing.
